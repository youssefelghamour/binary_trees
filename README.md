# 0x1D. C - Binary trees

## Overview

This repository contains the collaborative work of a group project undertaken by Mahmoud Hammam and Youssef El Ghamour, as part of the ALX Software Engineering program. This project contains implementations of various binary tree operations in C. Each file contains functions that perform specific tasks related to binary trees.
